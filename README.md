## DFS

Please find attached two files, one with [nodes](nodes.csv) and the other with [links](links.csv) of the same network. You have to perform a DFS in this network. Choose as initial node the node corresponding to the two first letters of your name (Ti). Other than that, you may examine a node's neighbors (adjacency list) in any order, and re-start DFS at any not yet visited node. You job is to return the two files with some extra information. In the node file, on each row, replace the words 'start' and 'finish' by the starting and ending times of the corresponding node. In the link file, on each row, replace 'tree/back/forward/cross' with the word that better conveys the type of corresponding edge. Hand in these two files with the extra information in csv format.
